About
------

This is the code with which I made all the plots for Clare's paper.

At this point, the code is archived.


Summary
-------

`train_predictors.py` can be used to train predictors 1, 1hs, 2, and 2hs, and to draw ROC curves 
showing the performance of those predictors on different validation and test sets.

`predictor.py` contains the files and classes required by `train_predictors.py`.
